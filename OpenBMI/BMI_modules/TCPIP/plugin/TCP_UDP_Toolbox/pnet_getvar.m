function varargout=pnet_getvar(fid)
% PNET_GETVAR - Gets any matlab variable (number-, cell-, struct- or object -array) from pnet.
%
% Syntax:  
%  
%   [variable1, variable2,.....]=pnet_getvar(con)
%  
%   Receives matlab variables over a TCP connection that was sent with
%   PNET_PUTVAR. This variable transfer uses its own non standard protocol.
%   Can also be used with UDP packets if the variable/variables fits inside
%   an UDP packet.
%  
% Se also:  PNET_PUTVAR, PNET, PNET_REMOTE
