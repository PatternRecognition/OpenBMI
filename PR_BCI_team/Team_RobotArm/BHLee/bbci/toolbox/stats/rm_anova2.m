% Two-factor, within-subject repeated measures ANOVA.
% For designs with two within-subject factors.
%
% Parameters:
%    Y          dependent variable (numeric) in a column vector
%    S          grouping variable for SUBJECT
%    F1         grouping variable for factor #1
%    F2         grouping variable for factor #2
%    F1name     name (character array) of factor #1
%    F2name     name (character array) of factor #2
%
%    Y should be a 1-d column vector with all of your data (numeric).
%    The grouping variables should also be 1-d numeric, each with same
%    length as Y. Each entry in each of the grouping vectors indicates the
%    level # (or subject #) of the corresponding entry in Y.
%
% Returns:
%    stats is a cell array with the usual ANOVA table:
%      Source / ss / df / ms / F / p
%
% Notes:
%    Program does not do any input validation, so it is up to you to make
%    sure that you have passed in the parameters in the correct form:
%
%       Y, S, F1, and F2 must be numeric vectors all of the same length.
%
%       There must be at least one value in Y for each possible combination
%       of S, F1, and F2 (i.e. there must be at least one measurement per
%       subject per condition).
%
%       If there is more than one measurement per subject X condition, then
%       the program will take the mean of those measurements.
